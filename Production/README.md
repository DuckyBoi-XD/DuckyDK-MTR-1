# Notes

These files are for files that I need to be made, like PCB and CAD models. I also added a Model of a rotary encoder knob that I'm going to get printed by printing legion (I've talked with a guy that printed my hackpad case and he said he could print my MTR case and knobs). This is because I had trouble finding knobs on ali and I think its cheaper to do it this way.
